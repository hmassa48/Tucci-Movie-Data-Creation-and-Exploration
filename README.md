# Stanley Tucci a Theatrical Genius
It should be no surprise to anyone that Stanley Tucci is the most influential actor of our time. There is absolutely nothing that man cannot play. He is a bald-headed genius with an aptitude for creativity and flair that others just cannot copy. So, it was nothing less than absolutely flooring during this week's episode of me being trapped in my parent's house that my dad confused the saving grace of this generation for Howie Mandell of America's Got Talent.Â 
So, I decided to work on this quick personal project to explore the depths of Stanley Tucci's talent, asking the question:
### Is there anything he can't do ? 

## Data Set Up

This project uses Stanley Tucci's wikipedia page as reference for his movie appearances. From this set up of movies, three different datasets were created. The first dataset was created from information scraped off of each movie's Wikipedia page.
